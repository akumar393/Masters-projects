The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) data are preliminary and subject,,,,,,,
to change as more data become available. All incidence rates are unadjusted.  FluSurv-NET conducts,,,,,,,
population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza related hospitalizations in,,,,,,,
children <18 years of age (since 2003-2004 influenza season) and adults (since 2005-2006 influenza,,,,,,,
season).  The FluSurv-NET covers over 70 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program (EIP),,,,,,,
"states (CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM, NY, OR, TN) and additional Influenza Hospitalization",,,,,,,
Surveillance Project (IHSP) states.   The IHSP began during the 2009-2010 season to enhance,,,,,,,
"surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  IHSP sites included IA, ID, MI, OK and SD during",,,,,,,
"2009-2010 season; ID, MI, OH, OK, RI, and UT during the 2010-2011 season; MI, OH, RI, and UT during",,,,,,,
"the 2011-2012 season; IA, MI, OH, RI, and UT during the 2012-2013 season; and MI, OH, and UT during",,,,,,,
"the 2013-2014 , 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons.  Cumulative and weekly unadjusted incidence rates",,,,,,,
"(per 100,000 population) are calculated using the National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS)",,,,,,,
population estimates for the counties included in the surveillance catchment area.  The rates,,,,,,,
"provided are likely to be underestimated as influenza-related hospitalizations can be missed,",,,,,,,
"either because testing is not performed, or because cases may be attributed to other causes of",,,,,,,
pneumonia or other common influenza-related complications.,,,,,,,
